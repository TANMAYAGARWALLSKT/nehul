          We dived into the fascinating world of Scamper. It's all about
          boosting creativity and coming up with new ideas. Basically, it's like
          a set of strategies to help us think differently about things. We went
          through each letter in "Scamper" and talked about what it stands for:
          <br /><br />
          - S: Substitute - this is all about swaping things out.<br /><br />

          - C: Combine - this encourages thinking about how different elements
          can be merged or combined to create something new.
          <br /><br />
          - A: Adapt - this focuses on how the subject can be adapted or
          modified to fit different circumstances or needs.
          <br /><br />
          - M: Modify - this involves changing or altering certain aspects or
          properties of the subjects.
          <br /><br />
          - P: Put to another use - Products can often be used for more than one
          purpose.
          <br /><br />
          - E: Eliminate - eliminate unnecessary elements from our idea to make
          it simpler and more focused.
          <br /><br />
          - R: Reverse/Rearrange - Look at ideas from different angles or
          rearrange its components to see what the new possibilities emerge.
          <br /><br />
          For each letter, we discussed how we can apply it to whatever we are
          working on.<br /><br />
