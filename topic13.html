            We dived into the fascinating world of Scamper. It's all about boosting creativity and coming up with new ideas. Basically, it's like a set of strategies to help us think differently about things. We went through each letter in "Scamper" and talked about what it stands for:
<br><br>
            - S: Substitute - this is all about swaping things out.<br><br>
            
            - C: Combine - this encourages thinking about how different elements can be merged or combined to create something new.
            <br><br>
            - A: Adapt - this focuses on how the subject can be adapted or modified to fit different circumstances or needs.
            <br><br>
            - M: Modify - this involves changing or altering certain aspects or properties of the subjects.
            <br><br>
            - P: Put to another use - Products can often be used for more than one purpose.
            <br><br>
            - E: Eliminate - eliminate unnecessary elements from our idea to make it simpler and more focused.
            <br><br>
            - R: Reverse/Rearrange - Look at ideas from different angles or rearrange its components to see what the new possibilities emerge.
            <br><br>
            For each letter, we discussed how we can apply it to whatever we are working on.<br><br>
