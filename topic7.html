          So in this class, sir gave us this interesting task. Basically, we had
          to draw a pattern as quickly as we could. But here's the catchâ€”it was
          a bit confusing! The pattern had some tricky twists and turns that
          made it challenging to follow. So, we had to rely on our quick
          thinking and drawing skills to get it right. It was fun.
