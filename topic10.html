          Introduction: In this class, we delve into the powerful framework of
          CATWOE, a conceptual tool designed by Peter Checkland as part of Soft
          Systems Methodology.<br /><br />
          CATWOE stands for Customers, Actors, Transformation, Weltanschauung
          (Worldview), Owners, and Environmental Constraints. <br /><br />This
          framework serves as a lens through which we can comprehensively
          analyze and understand complex organizational dynamics.<br /><br />
          CUSTOMERS - Identify and analyze the primary beneficiaries or
          stakeholders in a system or problem.<br /><br />
          ACTORS - Explore the roles and responsibilities of individuals or
          entities involved in the processes. <br /><br />TRANSFORMATION -
          Examine the processes and activities that convert inputs into desired
          outputs within an organizational context.<br /><br />
          WORLDVIEW - Delve into the underlying beliefs, values, and assumptions
          that influence how individuals perceive and interact with the system
          or problem.<br /><br />
          OWNERS - Investigate the entities or individuals who own and wield
          authority over the system, decision-making processes, or key aspects
          of the organization.<br /><br />
          ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS - Consider the external factors and
          limitations that impact the system, exploring how organizations
          navigate and adapt to their broader context.
