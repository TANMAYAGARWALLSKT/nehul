          Introduction: In this class, we delve into the powerful framework of
          CATWOE, a conceptual tool designed by Peter Checkland as part of Soft
          Systems Methodology.<br><br> CATWOE stands for Customers, Actors,
          Transformation, Weltanschauung (Worldview), Owners, and Environmental
          Constraints. <br><br>This framework serves as a lens through which we can
          comprehensively analyze and understand complex organizational dynamics.<br><br>
          CUSTOMERS - Identify and analyze the primary beneficiaries or
          stakeholders in a system or problem.<br><br> ACTORS - Explore the roles and
          responsibilities of individuals or entities involved in the processes.
          <br><br>TRANSFORMATION - Examine the processes and activities that convert
          inputs into desired outputs within an organizational context.<br><br>
          WORLDVIEW - Delve into the underlying beliefs, values, and assumptions
          that influence how individuals perceive and interact with the system
          or problem.<br><br> OWNERS - Investigate the entities or individuals who own and
          wield authority over the system, decision-making processes, or key
          aspects of the organization.<br><br> ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS -  Consider the
          external factors and limitations that impact the system, exploring how
          organizations navigate and adapt to their broader context.
