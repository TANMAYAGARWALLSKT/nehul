            The session was all about mind maps,
            In this, imagine organizing our thoughts and ideas in a visual way that resembles a tree with branches. That's exactly what a mind map is all about.
            <br><br>
            In class, we learned how to create mind maps, starting with a central idea or topic right in the middle. Then, we branched out from there, adding subtopics and related concepts. It's like building a roadmap for our thoughts.
            <br><br>
            We learned that mind maps can be incredibly versatile tools. They're great for brainstorming, taking notes, planning projects, studying for exams, and even organizing complex ideas. Plus, they engage both the left and right hemispheres of the brain, making it easier to understand and remember information.
            <br><br>
            During the class, we got hands-on experience creating our own mind maps on the topic NIFT ENTRANCE EXAM. We started with a central idea and then added branches for related subtopics, using keywords, images, and colors to make connections and emphasize key points.
            <br><br>
            Overall, it was an engaging and practical session that equipped us with a valuable tool for unlocking creativity, enhancing productivity, and improving our overall understanding of complex concepts.
