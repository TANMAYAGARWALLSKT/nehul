          The session was all about mind maps, In this, imagine organizing our
          thoughts and ideas in a visual way that resembles a tree with
          branches. That's exactly what a mind map is all about.
          <br /><br />
          In class, we learned how to create mind maps, starting with a central
          idea or topic right in the middle. Then, we branched out from there,
          adding subtopics and related concepts. It's like building a roadmap
          for our thoughts.
          <br /><br />
          We learned that mind maps can be incredibly versatile tools. They're
          great for brainstorming, taking notes, planning projects, studying for
          exams, and even organizing complex ideas. Plus, they engage both the
          left and right hemispheres of the brain, making it easier to
          understand and remember information.
          <br /><br />
          During the class, we got hands-on experience creating our own mind
          maps on the topic NIFT ENTRANCE EXAM. We started with a central idea
          and then added branches for related subtopics, using keywords, images,
          and colors to make connections and emphasize key points.
          <br /><br />
          Overall, it was an engaging and practical session that equipped us
          with a valuable tool for unlocking creativity, enhancing productivity,
          and improving our overall understanding of complex concepts.
