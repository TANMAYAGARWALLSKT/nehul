            A woman goes to a jeweler. Asks him to fix her Gold chain which was broken into 4 fragments each containing 3 links as shown in the image. He told her that he charges 250 rupees to break a link and 250 rupees to join a link and concludes that she'll be charged 2000 rupees for the makeover. But everyone gets shoked when the woman says she’ll have to pay only 1500 rupees.

            Were you able to make out how? Here’s the solution she takes one of the fragments and breaks the three links and uses them to join two fragments into one. Hence, she pays 1500 rupees.
