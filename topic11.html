          We were introduced to two pioneers of CTS:<br><br> TONY BUZAN - Tony Buzan was
          a renowned author, speaker, and educational consultant, best known for
          his work on mind mapping and memory techniques. He revolutionized the
          field of learning and cognitive psychology with his innovative methods
          for enhancing creativity, productivity, and memory retention. Through
          his numerous books and lectures, Buzan inspired millions to unlock
          their full potential by harnessing the power of their minds. His
          legacy continues to influence educators, students, and professionals
          worldwide.<br><br><br><br>  EDWARD DE BONO - Edward de Bono, a Maltese physician,
          psychologist, and author, is best known for his work in the field of
          creative thinking. Born in 1933, deBono has written over 60 books,
          which have been translated into 37 languages. He is the originator of
          the term "lateral thinking," which describes a thinking style that
          seeks to solve problems through an indirect and creative approach. De
          Bono's work has had a profound impact on fields such as education,
          business, and psychology, challenging conventional thinking patterns
          and promoting innovative solutions. His books, including "Six Thinking
          Hats" and "Lateral Thinking," continue to be influential in
          encouraging individuals and organizations to think more
          creatively and effectively
