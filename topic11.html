          Edward de Bono, a Maltese physician, psychologist, and author, is best
          known for his work in the field of creative thinking. Born in 1933,
          deBono has written over 60 books, which have been translated into 37
          languages. He is the originator of the term "lateral thinking," which
          describes a thinking style that seeks to solve problems through an
          indirect and creative approach. De Bono's work has had a profound
          impact on fields such as education, business, and psychology,
          challenging conventional thinking patterns and promoting innovative
          solutions. His books, including "Six Thinking Hats" and "Lateral
          Thinking," continue to be influential in encouraging individuals and
          organizations to think more creatively and effectively
