          We went to the resource centre and were given different tasks. <br />
          <br />
          Task 1 - We were then given a book to each group and were asked to
          discuss on how to creatively sell that particular book in 2 minutes .
          We were also said to mark others on their selling techniques. The task
          was fun and mind juggling. <br />
          <br />
          We as a group decided to mark each group on a specific criteria. We
          searched on key points of HOW TO SELL A BOOK EFFECTIVELY and found
          some key tips on which we judged each group . <br />
          <br />The book given to us was THE POWER OR CREATIVE INTELLIGENCE.

          Towards the end of the class we were told about EDWARD DE BONO's book
          "SIX THINKING HATS". Each group was allotted a hat, we got the black
          hat, and were told to make a Ppt on the same.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
