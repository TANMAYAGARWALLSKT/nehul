          We went to the resource centre and were given different tasks. <br />
          <br />
          Task 1 - We were then given a book to each group and were asked to
          discuss on how to creatively sell that particular book in 2 minutes .
          We were also said to mark others on their selling techniques. The task
          was fun and mind juggling. <br />
          <br />
          We as a group decided to mark each group on a specific criteria. We
          searched on key points of HOW TO SELL A BOOK EFFECTIVELY and found
          some key tips on which we judged each group . <br />
          <br />The book given to us was THE POWER OR CREATIVE INTELLIGENCE.

          Task 2 - Towards the end of the class we were told about EDWARD DE
          BONO's book "SIX THINKING HATS". Each group was allotted a hat, we got
          the black hat, and were told to make a Ppt on the same.
