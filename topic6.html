            How proefficeint are you with your knowledge about colors? Let’s figure it out using these few sentences, having a color hidden between letters in each one of them.<br><br>
            •	 A big old hungry dog appeared of our door every morning.<br><br>
            •	The cop persuaded him not to create a disturbance.<br><br>
            •	The Brazilian students Paulo lives around the corner from us.<br><br>
            •	You should not let an upstart like him bother you.<br><br>
            •	He let out the big yell, owing to the injuries he received when he feel.<br><br>
            •	La jolla venders decided to cut their price in half.<br><br>
            •	Long rayon fabrics were loaded on the truck.	<br><br>
            •	The Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli lacked the requisite documents to enter the U.S.<br><br>
            •	You should not sell this fossil very cheaply because it is rare specimen.<br><br>
            •	The new law hit everybody’s pocketbook pretty hard.<br><br>
            You must have found it easy to find out colors like yellow and gray. But definitely you would have never imagined that these sentences may also contain colors like gold, tan, lilac, olive and copper.
            Beware dear, all you know is not all what it exists in this world of Creative thinking skills.
