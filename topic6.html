          How proefficeint are you with your knowledge about colors? Let’s
          figure it out using these few sentences, having a color hidden between
          letters in each one of them.<br /><br />
          • A big old hungry dog appeared of our door every morning.<br /><br />
          • The cop persuaded him not to create a disturbance.<br /><br />
          • The Brazilian students Paulo lives around the corner from us.<br /><br />
          • You should not let an upstart like him bother you.<br /><br />
          • He let out the big yell, owing to the injuries he received when he
          feel.<br /><br />
          • La jolla venders decided to cut their price in half.<br /><br />
          • Long rayon fabrics were loaded on the truck. <br /><br />
          • The Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli lacked the requisite documents
          to enter the U.S.<br /><br />
          • You should not sell this fossil very cheaply because it is rare
          specimen.<br /><br />
          • The new law hit everybody’s pocketbook pretty hard.<br /><br />
          You must have found it easy to find out colors like yellow and gray.
          But definitely you would have never imagined that these sentences may
          also contain colors like gold, tan, lilac, olive and copper. Beware
          dear, all you know is not all what it exists in this world of Creative
          thinking skills.
