          Creative thinking skills are essential abilities that enable
          individuals to think in unique and imaginative ways. These skills
          involve generating new ideas, making connections between disparate
          concepts, and approaching problems from different angles. Creative
          thinking is not limited to artistic endeavors but is also crucial in
          fields such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
          (STEM), where innovative solutions are often required. Developing
          creative thinking skills can enhance problem-solving abilities, foster
          innovation, and promote a deeper understanding of complex issues.
