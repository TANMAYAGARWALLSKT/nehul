          Certainly! Here's a classic puzzle that involves connecting 9 dots
          with 4 straight lines, without lifting your pen from the paper:
          <br />
          <br />1. Start by drawing a line that connects the dots 1, 2, and 3 in
          a row.  <br />
          <br />
          2. Next, draw a line that starts from dot 4 and goes to dot 6, but
          continue the line beyond dot 6, extending it to connect with dot 9.
          <br />
          <br />
          3. Lastly, draw a line from dot 7 to dot 2, but continue this line
          beyond dot 2 to connect with dot 5. <br />
          <br />
          This solution requires you to think "outside the box" by extending the
          lines beyond the perceived boundaries of the square formed by the
          dots. This way, you can connect all 9 dots with just 4 straight lines.
